# DESCRIPTION: This task demonstrates fetching real-time data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API using Python and its libraries, processing the data, and visualizing it in a user-friendly manner. The programming language used is Python, renowned for its simplicity and efficiency in handling data-driven tasks. The script employs the requests library to make HTTP requests and retrieve JSON data from the API, which is then parsed into a Python dictionary for easy access. The extracted data is structured into a tabular format using the pandas library, which is ideal for data manipulation and analysis. The resulting DataFrame includes information about Bitcoin prices in different currencies. For visualization, the script leverages matplotlib and seaborn, two powerful libraries for creating informative and aesthetically pleasing plots. Using seaborn.barplot, the data is visualized as a bar chart, with Bitcoin prices plotted against different currencies. The seaborn library enhances the visual appeal of the plot with themes and color palettes, while matplotlib provides tools to customize the chartâ€™s size, labels, and title. By combining these libraries, the script transforms raw API data into a clean, informative visualization. To execute the script and obtain the output, first ensure Python is installed along with the required libraries (requests, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn). The script begins by fetching real-time Bitcoin data from the API, processes it to extract currency names and their corresponding rates, and organizes this data into a pandas DataFrame for easy visualization. The visualization is then created using seaborn.barplot, which generates a bar chart with the currency names on the x-axis and Bitcoin prices on the y-axis. The plot is styled using the seaborn "whitegrid" theme and a "viridis" color palette for a visually appealing and professional look. The chart also includes a title, "Bitcoin Prices by Currency," as well as labeled axes for clarity. Once the script is executed, the final output is displayed as a neatly formatted bar chart, providing an insightful comparison of Bitcoin prices across different currencies.
